# TensorFlow-Island
RemObjects Island platform CPU-native bindings for TensorFlow C API v1.15.0.  

The Island bindings allow using TensorFlow C API in higher-level, CPU-native abstractions with several modern languages: Swift, Oxygene, Java, Go and C#, enabling cross-platform native TensorFlow-based machine-learning applications on Windows, Linux, and MacOS platforms. 

Requires RemObjects Elements Island-platform Compiler. It is a LLVM-based compiler tool-chain capable of generating platform-native machine code on Windows, Linux, and MaxOS.

This repository has the following objectives:

 - A higher level abstraction of TensorFlow C-API,  cross-platform (Windows, Linux and MacOS), and native machine code;
 - Support performance-critical machine-learning and Artifical Intelligence algorithms;
 - Provide an additional set of customized TensorFlow Ops for Traffic and Transportation applications, such as
    -- Traffic Signal Optimizations
    -- Smart Driver APIs for Connected Vehicle Application Simulation
    -- Innovative Traffic Simulation Calibration
